    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Shriya Sreejith! I'm a junior at Bentonville West High School. I love exploring new technologies and creating innovative solutions. Outside of academics, I enjoy leading and participating in cultural events, especially through dance. I also mentor younger students, volunteer in my community, and love finding ways to connect technology with creativity.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

<body>
</p>In my free time, I enjoy reading books, dancing, and watching movies. I also love trying new food and choreographing performances. On weekends, I like exploring new places with friends and family. Dancing is one of my biggest passions - I not only perform but also create routines for cultural events and my own team. When I want to relax, I usually read or listen to music.</p>
