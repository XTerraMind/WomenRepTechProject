        <h2>Get To Know Sri</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in South India and I came to the US when I was 4-5 years
          old. I have been here since but have traveled back once in a while to
          visit family. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          I love living in NWA but would love to travel to different countries
          and experience a variety of cultures, peoples, and places. Some dream
          destinations include:
        </p>
        <div class="dreamLocations">
          <li>Switzerland</li>
          <li>Portugal</li>
          <li>France</li>
          <li>Italy</li>
          <li>North India</li>
          <li>Japan</li>

        <h3>Passion and Goals</h3>
        <p>
          I want to help use technology to solve real-world problems in
          communities that don't have the resources to provide for themselves. I
          want to learn and share my love and knowledge of tech to others to
          help them grow and become better. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to empower other girls and women to follow their dreams whether
          that be in a STEM related field or otherwise. Even though there might
          be under-representation of women in the tech field, I want to motivate
          young girls that it is possible for them to be successful in a
          male-dominated field. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          I would love to create or develop something related to AI and create
          my own business or company and grow from there or implement my
          knowledge into an already existing company and get big from there
        </p>
        <p>In the end its about being happy and rich :))</p>
